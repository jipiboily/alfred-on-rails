# Alfred on Rails

This is a basic experimentation of working with BatmanJS and Rails together. It is based on the Alfred demo app made by the team [@shopify](http://github.com/shopify) (who did [BatmanJS](http://batmanjs.org)) for BatmanJS.

It is not only based on the original Alfred app, but it is the same basic todo app but with a RailsStorage instead of LocalStorage (browser storage).


#### Most probably useless note
I used this Rails template: [http://railswizard.org/9733afb8abaf61d546fc](http://railswizard.org/9733afb8abaf61d546fc)
